# Udemy-Projects
This repository contains excercises from the Udemy course 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp' created by Jose Portilla. This comprehensive course taught me how to use the power of Python to analyze data and create beautiful visualizations. 
Here are a few of the topics of what I learned:

- Programming with Python
- NumPy with Python
- Using pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks
- Use pandas to handle Excel Files
- Web scraping with python
- Connect Python to SQL
- Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
- Use plotly for interactive visualizations

The excercises  offer the possibillity to reproduce the real analysis process using real data (like datasets on Kaggle) or fake data (created for the scope of the course)/

### Excercise 1: SF saleries
In this excersise I got some practice on my pandas skills. I worked with the SF Salaries Dataset from Kaggle.

### Excercise 2: Ecommerce Purchases
In this Exercise I was given given some Fake Data about some purchases done through Amazon! Most of the tasks can be solved in different ways. For the most part, the questions got progressively harder.

### Excersise 3: 911 calls capstone project
For this capstone project I analyzed some 911 call data from Kaggle. The data contains the following fields:

lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)
