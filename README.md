# Udemy-Projects
This repository contains excercises from the Udemy course 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp'.
This comprehensive course taught me how to use the power of Python to analyze data and create beautiful visualizations. 
Here are a few of the topics of what I learned:

- Programming with Python
- NumPy with Python
- Using pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks
- Use pandas to handle Excel Files
- Web scraping with python
- Connect Python to SQL
- Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
- Use plotly for interactive visualizations

### Excercise 1: SF saleries
In this excersise I got some practice on my pandas skills. I worked with the SF Salaries Dataset from Kaggle!

### Excercise 2: Ecommerce Purchases
In this Exercise I was given given some Fake Data about some purchases done through Amazon! Most of the tasks can be solved in different ways. For the most part, the questions get progressively harder.
